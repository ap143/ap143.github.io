# PublicCodes

Description of simulations:-

BFS: Breadth First Search Algorithm

BST: AVL Trees

Bubble Sorting: Contains Bubble Sort

Clock:  Conatins a clock made by r = theta plot on r/theta axes

Cloth: *Ignore the name* This is a 3D simulation of a ball falling on a trampoline.

DFS: A* Algorithm visualization

DFS_VIS: Visualization of DFS(including little interation) with display of arrival and departure times.

Disparity dots: Sorting visualization of disparity dots

Image Clustering: Application of Kruskal Algorithm on Images to cluster different regions. PS: I don't know computer vision(at least at the time of making this), so keep your expectations low.

Linear Regression: Linear Regression Visualized

Lorenz Attractor: Simulation of a [Lorenz Attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)

Maze Generator: Maze Generation using randomized depth first search

Non_Intersecting_Circles -> Random Stuff

Prime Variance: Plot of prime numbers on r = theta curve on r/theta axes(Inspired by https://youtu.be/EK32jo7i5LQ)

Primes: Plots primes on (r, r) in r/theta exes

Purple Rain: Inspired by "The Coding Train"(My first Processing simulation too)

Rubik22: 2x2x2 3D Rubik's Cube solver using depth first search bruteforce(Uncertain to give a result due to large number of possible combinations)

Rubik's_Cube: 3x3x3 3D Rubik's Cube solver using beginner's methods(Certain to give a non optimum solution)

Snake Game: Simple Snake game made using P5js

Sorting: Contains HeapSort, QuickSort and MergeSort

Sponge Fractral: 3D view of [Sponge Fractral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge)

Star field: Random Stuff(Inspired by the Coding train's coding challenge)

TicTacToe: Tic Tac Toe game AI implemented using depth first search

Vision_Pers: Check yourself

Waves: Plots waves and there superposition. Set custom speed, amplitude, frequency and type(Sine, Square, Pulse).
